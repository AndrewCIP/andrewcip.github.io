# My Appreticeship Begins!

## Who are three fellow apprentices and/or your Magister you have met?

- Nathan
- Quan
- James

## What is one Computer Graphics-related skill or interest each of them has?

- Nathan has an avid interest in video games and is eager to learn more about ray casting.
- Quan has an interest in Adobe Illustrator.
- James, like me, shares a heavy interest in game development.

## If you could explore any magical realm in the world, where would it be and why?
I would love to visit Japan because the country is home to many large gaming companies, amazing food, and interesting culture. I've never had the chance to travel outside of the United States and have many places I'd like to visit, but Japan would definitely be at the top of my list.

## Visions of Japan (Project 1 Description):
I initially went for a nature theme, but somewhere along the line, I thought it would be cool to tie in the place that I wanted to visit the most in the world. This led me to illustrating a bonzai tree with flowers in a flower pot. This contains squares/rectangles, circles/ovals, and triangles. I wanted to fill up the background a bit, so I put in mountains and the red sun that is emblematic of Japan's flag. A way I can see the them improving is learning how to make more defined, stylized renders that can give the image some texture. Maybe have the image look like parchment (weathered and preserved).

Something I thought that was impressive from me was that I enabled my geometry-based JavaScript files have the ability to stretch and scale freely. This can be seen with the circles on the tree as well as the triangles of the mountains and the dirt in the tree pot. Another accessible option is to allow the shapes to define their own individual colors.

## Arcane Planetarium (Project 2 Requirements Completed):
- A space-like background using an image texture.
- Apply grayscale filter.
- At least one orbit is elliptical.
- Use simple shapes and colors to present celestial bodies and orbits.
  - Doesn't have multiple colors, so I don't know if it fully counts.
- A complete solar system animation (sun and the eight planets).
- At least one planet orbits the sun.
- At least one moon orbits around a planet.
