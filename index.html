    <h1>My Magic Apprenticeship Begins!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello colleagues and magister! My name is Andrew Lewis and I am a graduate student who came across this opportunity
    from my previous mentors. My goal is to become a seasoned game developer and have a place in
    the industry. Before I started my major in computer science, I was actually focused in graphic arts. This class feels
    like a plesant combination of the two and I feel that I will be having a lot of fun with this. I look forward to an 
    amazing adventure with everyone.</p>
    <p>This is my first ever conjured portal that I'm hoping to master. I'm pretty proud of it, but it's lacking the bit
    flair, color, and artistic touch that would reflect me. As time goes on, I will keep honing this craft and evolving 
    its potential.</p>
    <h2>||| Who are three fellow apprentices and/or your Magister you have met?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nathan</li>
        <li>Quan</li>
        <li>James</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>||| What is one Computer Graphics-related skill or interest each of them has?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nathan has an avid interest in video games and is eager to learn more about ray casting.</li>
        <li>Quan has an interest in Adobe Illustrator.</li>
        <li>James, like me, shares a heavy interest in game development.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>||| If you could explore any magical realm in the world, where would it be and why?</h2>
    <p>I would love to visit Japan because the country is home to many large
        gaming companies, amazing food, and interesting culture. I've never
        had the chance to travel outside of the United States and have many
        places I like to visit, but Japan would definitely be the first.</p>
