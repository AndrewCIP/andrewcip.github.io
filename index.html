    <h1>Welcome To My Portal!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello colleagues and magister! My name is Andrew Lewis and I am a graduate student who came across this opportunity
    from my previous mentors. My goal is to become a seasoned game developer and have a place in
    the industry. Before I started my major in computer science, I was actually focused in graphic arts. This class feels
    like a plesant combination of the two and I feel that I will be having a lot of fun with this. I look forward to an 
    amazing adventure with everyone.</p>
    <p>This is my first ever conjured portal that I'm hoping to master. I'm pretty proud of it, but it's lacking the bit
    flair, color, and artistic touch that would reflect me. As time goes on, I will keep honing this craft and evolving 
    its potential.</p>

    <h4>My Quest To Japan...</h4>
    <p>I initially went for a nature theme, but somewhere along the line, I thought it would be cool to tie in the 
    place that I wanted to visit the most in the world. This led me to illustrating a bonzai tree with flowers in a 
    flower pot. This contains squares/rectangles, circles/ovals, and triangles. I wanted to fill up the background a 
    bit, so I put in mountains and the red sun that is emblematic of Japan's flag. A way I can see the them improving is 
    learning how to make more defined, stylized renders that can give the image some texture. Maybe have the image look 
    like parchment (weathered and preserved).</p>
    <p>Something I thought that was impressive from me was that I enabled my geometry-based JavaScript files have the 
    ability to stretch and scale freely. This can be seen with the circles on the tree as well as the triangles of 
    the mountains and the dirt in the tree pot. Another accessible option is to allow the shapes to define their own 
    individual colors.</p>
