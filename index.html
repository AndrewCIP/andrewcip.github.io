    <h1>Welcome To My Portal!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello colleagues and magister! My name is Andrew Lewis and I am a graduate student who came across this opportunity
    from my previous mentors. My goal is to become a seasoned game developer and have a place in
    the industry. Before I started my major in computer science, I was actually focused in graphic arts. This class feels
    like a plesant combination of the two and I feel that I will be having a lot of fun with this. I look forward to an 
    amazing adventure with everyone.</p>
    <p>This is my first ever conjured portal that I'm hoping to master. I'm pretty proud of it, but it's lacking the bit
    flair, color, and artistic touch that would reflect me. As time goes on, I will keep honing this craft and evolving 
    its potential.</p>
