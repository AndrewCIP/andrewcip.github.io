    <h1>My Apprenticeship Begins!</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Who are three fellow apprentices and/or your Magister you have met?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nathan</li>
        <li>Quan</li>
        <li>James</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is one Computer Graphics-related skill or interest each of them has?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nathan has an avid interest in video games and is eager to learn more about ray casting.</li>
        <li>Quan has an interest in Adobe Illustrator.</li>
        <li>James, like me, shares a heavy interest in game development.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>If you could explore any magical realm in the world, where would it be and why?</h2>
    <p>I would love to visit Japan because the country is home to many large
        gaming companies, amazing food, and interesting culture. I've never
        had the chance to travel outside of the United States and have many
        places I like to visit, but Japan would definitely be the first.</p>
